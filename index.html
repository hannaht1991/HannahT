<p>If you're anything like me (<a href="URL">Find out who 'me' is</a>), you enjoy keeping active - whether it be having a game of badminton with friends, going for a morning row, having a kick about with your housemates, or simply going for a walk with your family. If you do enjoy keeping active, you'll be pelased to hear, (if you haven't already), that <strong>exercise helps to delay the onset of osteoarthritis </strong> (OA)! So, if you're not already doing some exercise and raising that heart rate a few times a week, surely thats enough of an incentive to start now!</p>
<p>OA is a degenerative disease, which, although occurs predominantly in weight-bearing joints such as the hip and knee, can affect many other joints too. There is a lot of research being carried out worldwide in an attempt to better understand what OA is, why it develops and how we can detect it before its symptoms arise. Hopefully, these findings will help lead to better treatment therapies, and ultimately, a cure! </p>
<p> I have set up this website in an attempt to share with you some of the novel (and very exciting!) findings of this reseach, without you having to extract the key information out of (usually very complex) journal articles</p>
